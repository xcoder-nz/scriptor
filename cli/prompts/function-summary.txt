# Example 1
Input:
```{{language}}
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:

< FORMAT >
- Provide a one‑sentence summary in Markdown, prefaced by `**Summary:**`.  
- Then provide a code snippet showing typical usage, prefaced by `**Usage Example:**`.  
- Use proper syntax highlighting fences for `{{language}}`.  
- If you are unsure about the function’s purpose, output `UNSURE: [reason]`.
END FORMAT

< THOUGHT >
“First, I’ll parse the function signature and docstring to form the summary. Next, I’ll construct a minimal example demonstrating common use. Finally, I’ll format the output exactly as specified.”
